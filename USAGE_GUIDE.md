## üéØ Pro Tips for Better Results

### 1. Be Specific About Your Role
Instead of: "tech jobs"
Try: "backend engineer", "iOS developer", "machine learning engineer"

### 2. Use Standard Job Titles
The database uses common titles like:
- Software Engineer (not "Coder")
- Data Scientist (not "Data Wizard")
- Product Manager (not "Product Owner")

### 3. Specify Exact Locations When Possible
- Use state codes: "CA", "NY", "TX"
- Major cities work great: "San Francisco", "New York", "Austin"

### 4. Chain Your Searches
Start broad, then narrow:
1. "Show me all data science jobs"
2. "Filter those for California"
3. "Now show only those paying over $150k"
4. "Remove staffing agencies"

### 5. Research Before Applying
Always check:
- Company's H-1B approval rate
- Average salaries for your role
- Number of similar positions sponsored
- Primary office locations

- Remove filters: Try without salary requirements first

### "Too many results"
**Try:**
- Add location: "...in California"
- Add salary filter: "...paying over $100k"
- Exclude agencies: "...no staffing agencies"
